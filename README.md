# Introduction

Hangupsbot is a bot designed for working with Google Hangouts.
* **Mentions** :
  If somebody mentions you in a room, receive a private hangout from the bot with details onthe mention, 
  including context, room and person who mentioned you.
* **Syncouts** : 
  A syncout is two Hangout group chats that have their messages forwarded to each other, allowing seamless 
  interaction between the two rooms. Primarily used to beat the 150-member chat limit, but it can also be
  used for temporarily connecting teams together to interact.
* [**Hubot Integration**](https://github.com/nylonee/hangupsbot/wiki/Hubot-Integration) :
  Hangupsbot allows you to connect to [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/), instantly providing you access 
  to hundreds of developed chat tools and plugins.
* **Lookups** :
  Google Sheets can be attached to the bot, which allows you to look up data in the 
  spreadsheet instantly with just a few keywords.
* **Pushbullet API** :
  [Pushbullet](https://www.pushbullet.com/) support for mentions is available.
* **Plugins, sinks and hooks** : 
  The bot has [instructions for developing your own plugins, sinks and hooks]
  (https://github.com/nylonee/hangupsbot/wiki/Authoring-Bot-Extensions), allowing the bot to interact 
  with external services such as your company website, Google APIs and much more.
* **Plugin mania** : 
  eastereggs, games, nickname support - **[the list goes on]
    (https://github.com/nylonee/hangupsbot/wiki/Plugin-List)**!

# IMPORTANT

This is a [fork](https://gitlab.sabah.io/eol/mogunsamang) of a [fork](https://github.com/xmikos/hangupsbot).

* To execute: `python3 hangupsbot.py`
* Any current tests will be in `<path of hangupsbot.py>/tests/`
* Please see the original documentation which is reproduced below
  (after the TODO section)

# General Configuration for Administrators

Configuration directives can be specified in `config.json`.

Most configuration directives are specified **globally** 
* Global directives are always specified in the "root" of `config.json`.
* To specify a per-conversation directive, the same configuration option should
  be defined as `config.conversations[<conversation-id>].<configuration option>`.
* Per-conversation directives override global settings, if both are set.
* Manually-configured per-conversation directives are DEPRECATED.

## Plugins

The `plugins` key in `config.json` allows you to optionally specify a list of plugins
  that will be loaded by the bot on startup. If this option is left as `null`, then
  all available plugins will be loaded.

To specify the plugins to be loaded, first ensure that the correct `.py` files are 
  inside your `hangupsbot/plugin/` directory, then modify the `plugins` key in
  `config.json` to reflect which plugins/files you want to load e.g.
    `plugins: ["mentions", "default", "chance", "syncrooms"]`

Some plugins may require extra configuration as documented in this README. 
  `config.json` is the the configuration provider for the bot and its plugins.

Some interesting plugins:
* [mentions plugin]
  (https://github.com/nylonee/hangupsbot/wiki/Mentions-Plugin)
  * alert users when their names are mentioned in a chat
* [subscribe plugin]
  (https://github.com/nylonee/hangupsbot/wiki/Subscribe-Plugin)
  * alert users when keywords they are subscribed to are said in a chat 
* [syncout / syncrooms plugins]
  (https://github.com/nylonee/hangupsbot/wiki/Syncouts-Plugin)
  * relay chat messages between different hangout group conversations (syncrooms)
  * configure via bot commands (syncrooms_config)
  * automated translation via Google Translate of relayed messages (syncrooms_autotranslate)

# Interacting with the Bot

There are three general types of interactions with the bot:
* **`/bot` commands** begin with `/bot` e.g. `/bot dosomething`
  * some bot commands are admin-only
* **`/me` triggers** begin with `/me` and frequently form a complete sentence e.g.
  `/me rolls a dice`
  * these kind of triggers are generally accessible to all users
* custom interactions (usage and acessibility varies by plugin)

**Without any plugins**, the bot only recognises the following two `/bot` commands:

`/bot help`
* Bot lists all supported commands in a private message with the user
* If the user does not have a 1-on-1 channel open, it will publicly tell 
  the user to PM the bot and say hi.

`/bot ping`
* Bot replies with a `pong`.

`/bot optout`
* Toggles opt-in/opt-out of advanced bot features.
* Works by making existing 1-on-1 chat with the specific user invisible to the bot
  * Bot will continue responding to the user in a group chat, but any feature/plugin
    which requires a 1-on-1 chat is effectively disabled when toggled ON.

Please see the wiki for the **[list of plugins]
  (https://github.com/nylonee/hangupsbot/wiki/Plugin-List)** to find out more
  about each plugin and their usage.

# Debugging

* Run the bot with the `-d` parameter e.g. `python3 hangupsbot.py -d` - this
  lowers the log level to `INFO` for a more verbose and informative log file.
* `tail` the log file, which is probably located at
  `/<user>/.local/share/hangupsbot/hangupsbot.log` - the location varies by
  distro!
* Console output (STDOUT) is fairly limited whatever the log level, so rely
  on the output of the log file instead.
